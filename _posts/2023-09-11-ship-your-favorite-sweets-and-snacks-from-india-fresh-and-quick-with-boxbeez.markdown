BoxBeez offers fresh sweets and snacks from India to your door. We offer to buy the ship the same day of sweets and snacks from our partners. We offer 3-5 business day shipping so you can enjoy the freshness of the sweets and snacks.

Wait, international shipping becomes economical if I order about 10 kgs. How is this going to compare about buying at local stores abroad?

Yes, it is true that when you ship around 10 Kgs, you get economical rates. However, if your friend or neighbor wants to buy sweets and snacks at the same time, you could save on shipping and relish your favorite dishes without compromise. We can pack up to three small packages within shipping box – like   Russian Dolls. Just contact us and let know and we would be happy to support you.

How is it better to order from Boxbeez when I can order from the sweets house themselves?
Some of our partners do international shipping but Boxbeez can buy from more than one partner and ship it to you. If you are like us that want to try more than one shop, choose us.
